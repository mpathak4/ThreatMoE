# ThreatIntel Expert for CyberMoE / ThreatMoE

Purpose
ThreatIntel Expert is a specialist module designed to ingest, normalize, enrich, correlate, and score Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), TTPs, and threat metadata from external feeds and reports. It integrates into the CyberMoE platform as a domain expert that can be sparsely invoked by ThreatMoEâ€™s gating layer, and whose outputs are fused with other experts (Network, Endpoint, Malware, Identity, Cloud, Vulnerability, OT) for efficient, explainable detection and response.
